			<p class="para">Gone are the days when we rolled up our sleeves, opened 30 Google tabs, and spent hours searching for fun date ideas that are on budget in a nearby venue with positive reviews. While it is nice to end up with an encyclopaedia of cafes, dating is not supposed to feel like you're preparing for a ninja war. Date Gate was born so that when they say surprise me, we say here's the plan.</p>
			<p class="para"> Of course, date planning is not new, and a lot of websites offer to make dating cheaper and easier to plan. So what makes Date Gate different? Date Gate is not just couple-friendly, we recognize the importance of self-love with our self-partnered membership. Date Gate also has more diverse experiences; and is inclusive of all genders, sexualities, incomes, and relationship statuses.</p>

Why date planning?
Because dating is supposed to be fun and exciting not tiresome or prohibitively expensive.
London is the 8th priciest capital city for a date worldwide, where 20-30% of millennials cannot afford dating. Inflation is constantly squeezing leisure out of our lives. For example, single people spend 92% of their disposable income on average, whereas couples spend 83% of theirs. Not to mention that to make dating affordable, people have to actively look for mid-week specials, happy hours, and discounted set menus, which is an exhausting and time-consuming process. Date Gate allows people to introduce a reasonable dating budget that saves them both money and planning effort.
The dating community has a lot of injustices that often go ignored, from the gender pay gap to the more expensive single life. Did you know that single people have to earn £3.35 per hour more than couples to attain the same decent standard of living? DateGate is determined on introducing justice to dating by being an accurate reflection of reality, which is why our plans are cheaper for women and single people.
