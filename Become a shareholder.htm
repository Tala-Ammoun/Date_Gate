	<h3> Date Gate is an incubator for its in-house entreprenuers </h3>
	If you have your own idea and have reached Officer level, you can submit your business plan to Date Gate and receive the necessary funding and resources such as marketing and legal to make it happen. The only condition is that you maintain our no-employee policy.

<h3> We want to know you </h3>
	If you're thinking "this is my dream company", we would like to welcome you on board! 
	<br>
	<br>
	It is our ultimate purpose to free everyone from the financial and intellectual constraints of employment. The sucky reality is that we have a limited number of shares, so we inevitably have a limited number of positions. Therefore, we cannot offer everyone shares in Date Gate, not until we become a publicly listed company, and we will be!
	<br>
	<br>
	So to get us acquainted, we designed our own platform, Empire, where you get to share your story and we get to share ours. No forms, no cover letters, no interviews. The only platform where you don't have to sell yourself for money to survive. The only platform where the only thing that matters, is your purpose. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Simply download the app and chat directly with one of our partners to tell them your purpose, and they will try their best to help you fulfill it, if not at Date Gate, in some other way or form. Join us today on the journey to freedom!
